    <h1>Questions, Questions, Questions, flooding into the mind of the concerned young person today...</h1>

  <h3>Why can't I post anything?</h3>

  <p>If you don't see the "compose" link in the navigation, you probably logged in with an account that didn't end in @colby.edu.</p>

  <h3>Can I sign in without using my Google account?</h3>

  <p>Currently the only way to create an account on The Better Announcements is to login using your Google account. Since @colby.edu accounts are technically Google accounts, this covers 100% of the people we want to help.</p>

  <h3>What if I have a Colby Gmail and a Personal Gmail?</h3>

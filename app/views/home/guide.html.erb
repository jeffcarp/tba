  <h2>Be civil</h2>

  <p>Please, let's keep it friendly.</p>

  <h2>Everything is changing</h2>

  <p>We're constantly experimenting with this and trying to make it better. If a 600 character limit turns out to be better than the current 500, we'll change it. We're in this for the long run and want to make it work. To do so, we need your <a href="mailto:gcarpenterv@gmail.com">feedback.</a></p>

  <h1>Likes</h1>

  <p>If you're a Colby student, you can 'like' posts if you're reading on <a href="/">announcements.io</a>. (We're thinking about expanding this to everybody). Posts are ordered by the number of likes each user has. E.g. if John has 5 total likes and Jeff has 3 total likes, John's posts will appear above Jeff's.</p>

  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>The quest to improve the General Announcements began in the spring of 2012 when Jonathan Kalin '14 was dissatisfied with the current announcements and decided to do something about it. He teamed up with Jeff Carpenter '12 and together they started thinking of a ton of ways to improve upon the General Announcements. We hope The Better Announcements is a delight to use and brings you closer to the Colby community.</p>

  <p>The Better Announcements is in no way connected with The General Announcements. Decisions are made solely by Jeff and John. We receive minimal funding from SGA to keep the site running.</p>

    <h1>Questions, Questions, Questions, flooding into the mind of the concerned young person today...</h1>

  <h2>Why can't I post anything?</h2>

  <p>If you don't see the "compose" link in the navigation, you probably logged in with an account that didn't end in @colby.edu.</p>

<!--   <p><strong>Updated 9/3/12:</strong> This feature is currently unavailable since it poses a security risk for those logged in on public computers. We're working on a fix for the fix.</p>

  <p>(We can still link your accounts manually. Contact us if you'd like us to.)</p>

<s>
  <p><strong>Updated 9/2/12:</strong> we now have a fix for this.</p>

  <p>If you're a Colby student who uses a separate Gmail account as your primary email, you're going to have to do the following (open each sequentially in a new tab):</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout">Log out of Gmail/Google</a></li>
    <li><a href="/logout">Log out of The Better Announcements</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://gmail.com">Log back into Gmail/Google with your Colby account</a></li>
    <li><a href="/">Log back into The Better Announcements</a></li>
  </ol>
</s> -->

  <h2>Can I sign in without using my Google account?</h2>

  <p>Currently the only way to create an account on The Better Announcements is to login using your Google account. Since @colby.edu accounts are technically Google accounts, this covers 100% of the people we want to help.</p>

  <h2>What if I only want your announcements?</h2>

  <p>If you're ready to take this relationship to the next level, you can <a href="http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/its/services/notices/unsubscribe.cfm">unsubscribe from the general announcements.</a> If you're not ready to do that yet, that's cool, we can still be friends.</p>

  <h2>How many Colby students are on The Better Announcements?</h2>

  <p>Between 0 and 1825.</p>

  <h2>Jeff, I see you using cool formatting in your posts. How can I be like you?</h2>

  <p>All posts are formatted using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>. I plan on making this more clear on the site soon.</p>

  <h2>How do I delete my account?</h2>
